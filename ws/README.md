# Workshop

## Analysis of weighted networks [Sunbelt 2025](https://www.insna.org/sunbelt-2025-workshops)

The structure of the network N=(V, L, W, P) is determined by the graph G=(V, L), where V is the set of nodes and L is the set of links.
In addition, additional data about links (weights from W) and nodes (properties from P) are often known. The network N is weighted if its set of weights is nonempty. The weights can be either measured (such as [trade networks - BACI/CEPII](https://www.cepii.fr/CEPII/en/bdd_modele/bdd_modele_item.asp?id=37)) or computed (for example a projection of a two-mode network).

The workshop will cover the following topics:
  - examples and sources of weighted networks,
  - transformations of weighted networks (dealing with large ranges of values of weight, making nodes comparable, Balassa index),
  - visualization of weighted networks (graph drawing, monotonic recoding, matrix representation, ordering of nodes),
  - clustering and blockmodeling.
  - important nodes - hubs and authorities,
  - skeletons - important parts of the network: cuts, k-neighbors, Pathfinder, cores, trusses, backbone, islands,
  -  temporal weighted networks.

Most of the topics are discussed in the book Batagelj, Doreian, Ferligoj, KejzÌ†ar (2014) [Understanding Large Temporal Networks and Spatial Networks](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781118915370).

The workshop is based on the [programming system R](https://cran.r-project.org/). The network data and additional R code will be available on GitHub
