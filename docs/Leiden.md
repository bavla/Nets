# Leiden

Workshop on the sustainability of network analysis software in Leiden, the Netherlands, 21-22 June 2023

https://igraph.org/workshop.html

- Sustainability -
evolution of the field - rewriting, building a new tool on the basis of accumulated experience 
- the concept of network -> language.  Is it strong enough to express the problems?
arcs/edges - multiple
support by data file formats, data structures, operations/algorithms
concepts \ (formalization / theory \\) \ abstract structures, operations (library) / UI tools, langs / Word effect (adaptable GUI) 
\ rewriting (parallel, distributed, ...)
Open source / prog language, documentation
- Pajek - pascal; Andrej doesn't like (keeping consistency, problem of versions, dictator (Python)(=). Pajek (1996):
  - prehistory: switching circuits, Harary, Berge, Zykov, general Euler path problem, inductive classes, algorithms, package graph, Xgraph,
  - Andrej, drawing package
  - GUI tool for large networks for sociologists (now, most researchers know R or Python) -> library
  - Graph drawing - new types of networks
  - special algorithms for large networks (most of algorithm with large time complexity left for other packeges)
  - transition 32bits to 64bits - Delphi compiler was late
  - improving "calculator" - transformations of basic data structures; some new algorithms

- the problem of changes in graphical formats (3D)
- top-level - book on network data structures and algorithms
- evolutive design (difference between python and R - tidy)
- new data types
  - algebraic structures
  - structured values (symbolic data: intervals, distributions, sets, ...), temporal quantities, functions (netExcel)
  - multiway networks
  - kinship (GEDCOM), Petri nets,
  - inductive classes
  - spatial data <-> graphics
- 2 CSV tables; JSON (preserving the structure of the data, including metadata); GraphML
- alternative node labels
- the importance of the well-documented data sets
- terminology  (node, vertex, point,  ; link, connection, line, tie, bond, edge, arc, )
- Leskovec SNAP   http://snap.stanford.edu/ 
- interoperability on data level - common file exchange format
