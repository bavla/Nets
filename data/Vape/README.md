The survey included gender, age, level of education, vape status, and peer influence status. Vape status was positive if the student responded "true" to vaping at least once every 2 weeks. Students were also asked to list three friends in their high school in order of decreasing  strength of the friendship (friendship tie strength of one being weakest, i.e. friend listed last, and three being strongest).
