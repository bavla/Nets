<h3>Background</h3>
In the experiment two alternative methods were used for collection
of network data:
<ul>
 <li> Recall: Members of the group were asked to identify the members
   of their egocentric networks by memory. The criteria for
   enumeration was frequency of the recalled communications.
 <li> Recognition: The list of all members of the group was given to
   each member. They were first asked to identify who they
   communicate with and than to select the persons they communicate
   with most often.
</ul>
The number of listed persons was not limited in any method.
</p><p>
The analyzed network consisted of communication interactions among
twelve members and advisors of the Student Government at the
University in Ljubljana. The results of the measurement are not real
interactions among actors but cognition about communication
interactions. Data were collected with face to face interviews
which lasted from 20 to 30 minutes. Interviews were conducted
in May 1992.
</p><p>
Communication flow among actors was identified by three
questions:
<ul>
 <li> Who of the members and advisors of the Student government do you
   (most often) informally discuss with?
 <li> Which members and advisors of the Student Government do you
   (most often) ask for an opinion?
 <li> Which of the members and advisors of the Student Government
   (most often) ask you for an opinion?
</ul>
The content of the communication flow was limited to the matters of
the Student Government. The time frame was also defined: questions
were referred to the six months period (from the formation of the
government to the day of the interview).
</p><p>
Only one respondent listed all the others under the recognition
method for two relations (discussion, asking for an opinion). For
that respondent the first group was defined arbitrary. The cut
point was determined by the average number of selected persons at
the recognition method (3.5 for the first relation and 4.5 for
the second).
</p><p>
One respondent refused to cooperate in the experiment. As he
was not considered in the analysis, the network consists of
eleven actors.
