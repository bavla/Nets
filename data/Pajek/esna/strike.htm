<p><b>Dataset</b> &nbsp; <code>Strike</code></p>
<p><b>Description</b></p>
<p>
<tt>Strike.net</tt>: 24 vertices (employees), 38 edges (discussed the strike in some
minimum frequency), no arcs, no loops, no line values.<br>
<tt>Strike_groups.clu</tt>: classification of the (24) employees according to age and
ethnic group: 1 - Spanish-speaking employees, 2 - young (30 or
younger) English-speaking employees, 3 - old (over 30) English-
speaking employees.<br>
<tt>Strike.paj</tt>: Pajek project file containing both files.

<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p>
In a wood-processing facility, a new management team proposed changes
to the workers' compensation package, which the workers did not accept.
They started a strike, which led to a negotiation stalemate. Then,
management asked an outsider to analyze the communication structure
among the employees because it felt that information about the proposed
changes was not effectively communicated to all employees by the union
negotiators.<br>
The outside consultant asked all employees to indicate the frequency in
which they discussed the strike with each of their colleagues on a 5-point
scale, ranging from 'almost never' (less then once per week) to 'very
often' (several times per day). The consultant used three as a cut-off
value. If at least one of two persons indicated that they discussed work
with a frequency of three or more, a line between them was added to the
informal communication network.<br>
The network displays fairly stringent demarcations between groups
defined on age and language. The Spanish-speaking young employees, who
are of age 30 or younger, are almost disconnected from the English-
speaking young employees, who communicate with no more than two of
the older English-speaking employees.<br>
All ties between groups have special backgrounds. Among the
Hispanics, Alejandro is most proficient in English and Bob speaks some
Spanish, which explains their tie. Bob owes Norm for getting his job and
probably because of this, they developed a friendship tie. Finally, Ozzie is
the father of Karl.
