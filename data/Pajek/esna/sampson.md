<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p>
The data stem from an ethnographic study of community structure in a
New England monastery by Samuel F. Sampson. The study describes
several social relations among a group of men (novices) who were
preparing to join a monastic order. The data sets presented here contain the
affect relations among the novices, which were collected by asking them to
indicate whom they liked most and whom they liked least. The novices
were asked for a first, second, and third choice on both questions.
The social relations were measured at five moments in time. The fourth
measurement (at time T4) took place one week before four of the
novitiates were expelled from the monastery.<br>
Some novices had attended the minor seminary of 'Cloisterville' before
they came to the monastery. <br>
Based on his observations and analyses, Sampson divided the novices into
four groups: Young Turks, Loyal Opposition, Outcasts, and an interstitial
group. The Loyal Opposition consists of the novices who entered the
monastery first. The Young Turks arrived later, in a period of change.
They questioned practices in the monastery, which the members of the
Loyal Opposition defended. Some novices did not take sides in this debate,
so they are labeled 'interstitial'. The Outcasts are novices who were not
accepted in the group.
