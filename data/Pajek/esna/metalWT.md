<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p>
The files contain data on trade miscellaneous manufactures of metal among
80 countries in 1994. All countries with entries in the paper version of the
Commodity Trade Statistics published by the United Nations were
included, but for some countries the 1993 data (Austria, Seychelles,
Bangladesh, Croatia, and Barbados) or 1995 data (South Africa and
Ecuador) were used because they were not available for 1994. Countries
which are not sovereign are excluded because additional economic data
were not available: Faeroe Islands and Greenland, which belong to
Denmark, and Macau (Portugal). Most missing countries are located in
central Africa and the Middle East, or belong to the former USSR.
The arcs represent imports by one country from another for the class of
commodities designated as 'miscellaneous manufactures of metal', which
represents high technology products or heavy manufacture. The absolute
value of imports (in 1,000 US$) is used but imports with values less than
1% of the country's total imports were omitted. <br>
In addition, several attributes of the countries were coded: their continent,
their structural world system position in 1994, their world system position in
1980 according to a previous analysis by Smith and White - see the
reference below -  and their Gross Domestic Product per capita in US$ in
1995 (Statistical Yearbook of the United Nations).
