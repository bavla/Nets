<p><b>Dataset</b> &nbsp; <code>SanJuanSur</code></p>
<p><b>Description</b></p>
<p>
<tt>SanJuanSur.net</tt>: 75 vertices (families), 199 arcs (visiting relations), line
values (1 -ordinary visits, 2 - visits among kin, 3 - visits among ritual
kin), no edges, no loops.
<tt>SanJuanSur_status.clu</tt>: ethnographic classification of the families in
<code>SanJuanSur.net</code> into 14 social status groups indicating the average
importance of the family's members (class numbers 1 to 14; higher
classes represent higher status).
<tt>SanJuanSur_leaders.clu</tt>: identification of (the families containing) the
prestige leaders, who were identified as those people who received
more than 10 nominations within the community on the question: Which
persons would you pick to represent you and the people of this place on
a commission? (class 1 - prestige leaders, 0 - other).<br>

<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p>
In 1948, American sociologists executed a large field study in the Turrialba
region, which is a rural area in Costa Rica (Latin America). They were
interested in the impact of formal and informal social systems on social
change. Among other things, they  investigated visiting relations between
families living in haciendas (farms) in a neighborhood called San Juan Sur.
The network of visiting ties is a simple directed graph: each arc represents
"frequent visits" from one family to another. The exact number of visits
was not recorded. Line values classify the visiting relation as ordinary
(value one), visits among kin (value two), and visits among ritual kin, i.e.,
between god-parent and god-child.
