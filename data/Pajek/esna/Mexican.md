<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p>
In Mexico, political power has been in the hands of a relatively small set of
people who are connected by business relations, family ties, friendship, and
membership of political institutions throughout most of the 20th century. A
striking case in point is the succession of presidents, especially the
nomination of the candidates for the presidential election. Since 1929, each
new president was a secretary in the previous cabinet, which means that
he worked closely together with the previous president. Moreover, the
candidates always entertained close ties with former presidents and their
closest collaborators. In this way, a political elite has maintained control
over the country.<br>
The network contains the core of this political elite: the presidents and their
closest collaborators. In this network, edges represent significant political,
kinship, friendship, or business ties.<br>
Notwithstanding the fact that one political party (the Partido Revolucionario
Institucional) won all elections in the period under consideration, two (or
more) groups within this party have been competing for power. The main
opposition seems to be situated between civilians  and members of the
military. After the revolution, the political elite was dominated by the
military but gradually the civilians have assumed power.
