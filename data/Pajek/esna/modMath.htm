<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p>
This network concerns the diffusion of a new mathematics method in the
1950s. This innovation was instigated by top mathematicians and sponsored
by the National Science Foundation of the USA as well as the U.S.
Department of Education. The diffusion process was successful since the
new method was adopted in a relatively short period by most schools.
The example traces the diffusion of the modern math method among
school systems which combine elementary and secondary programs in
Allegheny County (Pennsylvania, USA). All school superintendents who
were at least two years in office were interviewed. They are the
gatekeepers to educational innovation because they are in the position to
make the final decision. The researchers obtained data from 61 out of 68
superintendents, 51 of whom had adopted by 1963 (84%).
Among other things, the superintendents were asked to indicate their
friendship ties with other superintendents in the county with the following
question: Among the chief school administrators in Allegheny County, who
are your three best friends?<br>
The researcher analyzed the friendship choices among the 38
interviewed superintendents who adopted the method and were in position
at least one year before the first adoption, so they could have adopted
earlier. Unfortunately, the researcher did not include the friendship choices
by superintendents who did not receive any choices themselves; they are
treated as isolates. In the original network, some friendship choices are
reciprocated and others are not (<code>ModMath_directed.net</code>) but we will
use the symmetrized network (<code>ModMath.net</code>). A line in this network
indicates that at least one superintendent chooses the other as his friend.
The year of adoption by a superintendent's school is coded in the
partition <code>ModMath_adoption.clu</code>: 1958 is class (time) one, 1959 is class
(time) two, etc. The first adopter (v1) is a superintendent with many
contacts outside Allegheny County but few friends within the county. He is
a 'cosmopolite' and cosmopolites usually are early adopters but they are
often too innovative to be influential in a local network.
