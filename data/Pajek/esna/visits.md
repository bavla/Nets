<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p>
In 1948, American sociologists executed a large field study in the Turrialba
region, which is a rural area in Costa Rica (Latin America). They were
interested in the impact of formal and informal social systems on social
change. Among other things, they  investigated visiting relations between
families living in haciendas (farms) in a neighborhood called Attiro. The
network of visiting ties is a simple directed graph: each arc represents
"frequent visits" from one family to another. The exact number of visits
was not recorded. Line values classify the visiting relation as ordinary
(value one), visits among kin (value two), and visits among ritual kin, i.e.,
between god-parent and god-child. <br>
The investigators proposed an ethnographic classification of the families
into six family-friendship groupings on substantive criteria. In rural areas
where there is little opportunity to move up and down the social ladder
social groups are usually based on family relations. <br>
Similar data are available for another village in the same area: San Juan
Sur. In addition, for San Juan Sur, a network is available with the arcs
representing the answers of the (head of) families to the question: "In case
of a death in the family, whom would you notify first?". In this file
(SanJuanSur_deathmessage.net), the coordinates of families correspond
with the locations of families in the original sociogram drawn by the
researchers.
