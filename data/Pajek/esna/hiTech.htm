<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p>
The case is a small hi-tech computer firm which sells, installs, and
maintains computer systems. The network contains the friendship ties
among the employees, which were gathered by means of the question:
Who do you consider to be a personal friend? Three employees (Fran,
Quincy, and York) did not return the questionnaire. Note that most
friendship nominations are reciprocated, but not all (112 out of 147).
A friendship choice (arc) is only included in the network if both
persons involved acknowledge it.<br>
Some months later, employees tried to unionize the firm: they sought
support among the employees to let the union have a say in the firm. The
three top managers and three employees who were not directly involved
were opposed to union certification of the firm. Five employees were pro-
union, but two of them (Chris and Ovid) did not actively advocate the pro-
union position. At the end, the proposal to unionize the firm was voted
down. Chris resigned from the firm ten days before the vote because he
did not want to participate in it. He rejoined the firm two days after the
vote.
