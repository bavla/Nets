<h2>Family planning in Korea.</h2>

<p><b>Dataset</b> &nbsp; <code>Korea</code></p>
<p><b>Description</b></p>
<p>
<tt>Korea1.net</tt>: 39 vertices (women), 69 edges (discuss family planning), no
arcs, no loops, no line values.<br>
<tt>Korea2.net</tt>: 39 vertices (women), 84 edges (discuss family planning), no
arcs, no loops, no line values.
In addition, we know which women adopted family planning methods at
least temporarily (class one in the partitions)<br>
<tt>Korea1_adopters.clu</tt>: classification of the (39) women in Korea1.net
according to adoption of family planning methods: 0 - did not adopt, 1 -
adopted<br>
<tt>Korea2_adopters.clu</tt>: idem for <code>Korea1.net</code>.<br>
<tt>Korea1_members.clu</tt>: classification of the (39) women in <code>Korea1.net</code>
according to membership of the local Mothers' Club: 0 - was not a
member, 1 - was a member.<br>
<tt>Korea2_members.clu</tt>: idem for <code>Korea2.net</code>.<br>
<tt>Korea.paj</tt>: Pajek project file containing all of these files.

<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p>
This is a communication network within a small enterprise: a sawmill. All
employees were asked to indicate the frequency with which they discussed
work matters with each of their colleagues on a five-point scale ranging
from less than once a week to several times a day. Two employees were
linked in the communication network if they rated their contact as three or
more. We do not know whether both employees had to rate their tie in this
way or that at least one employee had to indicate a strength of three or
more.<br>
In the sawmill, the employees are Spanish-speaking (H) or English-
speaking (E), which, of course, is relevant to their communication. The
sawmill contains two main sections: the mill (M), where tree trunks are
sawn into logs, and the planer section (P), where logs are planed. Then
there is a yard (Y) where two employees are working, and some managers
and additional officials. Vertex labels indicate the ethnicity and the type of
work of each employee, e.g. HP-10 is an Hispanic (H) working in the
planer section (P).
