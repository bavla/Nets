<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p>
In 1943, Leslie D. Zeleny administered a sociometric test to 48 cadet pilots
at an US Army Air Forces flying school. Cadets were trained to fly a two-
seated aircraft, taking turns in flying and aerial observing. Cadets were
assigned to instruction groups ranging in size from 5 to 7 at random, so they
had little or no control over  who their flying partners would be. The
sociometric test was used to improve the composition of instruction groups.
Zeleny asked each cadet to name the members of his flight group with
whom he would like to fly as well as those with whom he would not like to
fly.
