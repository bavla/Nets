<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p>
Fine G.A. (1987) reports sociometric data for two very successful <i>Little League
baseball team</i> in the same local league. Fine G.A.'s primary concern was to examine the
creation and elaboration of various forms of idioculture which he defined as
"a system of knowledge, beliefs, behaviors and customs shared by members of
an interacting group to which the members can refer and that serve as the
basis for further interaction" (1987:125). He contends that the
sociometric structure of such teams conditions the formation of their
idiocultures.
<p>
Fine G.A.  asked the boys to list their three best friends on the team.
<br>
Fine G.A.  provides descriptions of only a few team members from the <i>Transatlantic
Industries</i> [TI] team. Frank is listed as the coach's son who received preferential
treatment from his father in terms of playing time. Four other team members
regarded him as one of their three best friends. "Tom, a quiet, mature,
responsible twelve year old, was one of TI's best players..." was named as
a best friend by five other team members. Ron received the most friendship
nominations and Darrin was the best batter on the team. Fine G.A.  describes TI as
a decentralized team.
<br>
The data for the <i>Sharpstone Auto</i> [SA] team  consist of best friendship
nominations made by the team members at the end of the season. In describing the
structure of this team, Fine G.A.  mentions only three of the boys. Justin is
characterized as a very talented (he was seen by many as the best player in the league),
aggressive and fearless ballplayer who is the team leader. Harry is listed as another fine
player (best pitcher) and Justin's best friend. Whit is a good friend of
both Justin and Harry. However, he was a year younger than these players
and, while able, was not as good a player. "These three
players...constituted the heart and soul of Sharpstone Auto" (Fine G.A., 1987:140)
and Fine G.A. saw the team as highly centralized.
