<p><b>DESCRIPTION</b> 	Two 58&#215;58 matrices:
 <blockquote>
  <CODE>BKFRAB</CODE> symmetric, valued.<br>
  <CODE>BKFRAC</CODE> non-symmetric, valued (rankings).
 </blockquote>

<p><b>BACKGROUND</b>
Bernard &amp; Killworth, later with the help of Sailer, collected five
sets of data on human interactions in bounded groups and on the actors'
ability to recall those interactions. In each study they obtained
measures of social interaction among all actors, and ranking data based
on the subjects' memory of those interactions. The names of all cognitive
(recall) matrices end in C, those of the behavioral measures in B.
<p>
These data concern interactions among students living in a fraternity at a
West Virginia college. All subjects had been residents in the fraternity
from three months to three years. <CODE>BKFRAB</CODE> records the number
of times a pair of subjects were seen in conversation by an "unobtrusive"
observer (who walked through the public areas of the building every fifteen
minutes, 21 hours a day, for five days). <CODE>BKFRAC</CODE> contains
rankings made by the subjects of how frequently they interacted with
other subjects in the observation week.

In the 1950s John Gagnon collected sociometric choice data from 67
prison inmates. All were asked, "What fellows on the tier are you closest
friends with?"  Each was free to choose as few or as many "friends" as he
desired. The data were analyzed by MacRae and characterized by him as
"less clear cut" in their internal structure than similar data from schools or
residential populations.

  <CODE>KAPFMU</CODE> symmetric, binary.
 </blockquote>

<p><b>BACKGROUND</b>
Bruce Kapferer (1969) collected data on men working on the surface in a
mining operation in Zambia (then Northern Rhodesia). He wanted to
account for the development and resolution of a conflict among the
workers. The conflict centered on two men, Abraham and Donald;  most
workers ended up supporting Abraham.
<p>
Kapferer observed and recorded several types of interactions among the
workers, including conversation, joking, job assistance, cash assistance
and personal assistance. Unfortunately, he did not publish these data.
Instead, the matrices indicate the workers joined only by uniplex ties
(based on one relationship only, <CODE>KAPFMU</CODE>) or those joined
by multiple-relation or multiplex ties (<CODE>KAPFMM</CODE>).

<p><b>BACKGROUND</b>
Bruce Kapferer (1972) observed interactions in a tailor shop in Zambia
(then Northern Rhodesia) over a period of ten months. His focus was the
changing patterns of alliance among workers during extended negotiations
for higher wages.
<p>
The matrices represent two different types of interaction, recorded at two
different times (seven months apart) over a period of one month. TI1 and
TI2 record the "instrumental" (work- and assistance-related) interactions at
the two times;  TS1 and TS2 the "sociational" (friendship, socioemotional)
interactions.
<p>
The data are particularly interesting since an abortive strike occurred after
the first set of observations, and a successful strike took place after the
second.

<p><b>BACKGROUND</b>
David Krackhardt collected cognitive social structure data from 21
management personnel in a high-tech, machine manufacturing firm to
assess the effects of a recent management intervention program. The
relation queried was "Who does X go to for advice and help with work?"
(<CODE>KRACKAD</CODE>) and "Who is a friend of X?" (<CODE>KRACKFR</CODE>).
Each person indicated not only his or her own advice and friendship
relationships, but also the relations he or she perceived among all
other managers, generating a full 21 &#215; 21 matrix of adjacency
ratings from each person in the group.

allowed.
<p>
The men were recruited to live in off-campus (fraternity) housing, rented
for them as part of the Michigan Group Study Project supervised by
Theodore Newcomb from 1953 to 1956. All were incoming transfer
students with no prior acquaintance of one another.

<p> Two 16&#215;16 matrices:
 <blockquote>
  <CODE>PADGB</CODE> symmetric binary<br>
  <CODE>PADGM</CODE> symmetric binary
 </blockquote>
 <CODE>PADGW</CODE>
<p>	One 16&#215;3 matrix, valued.

<p><b>BACKGROUND</b>
Breiger &amp; Pattison (1986), in their discussion of local role analysis,
use a subset of data on the social relations among Renaissance Florentine
families (person aggregates) collected by John Padgett from historical
documents. The two relations are business ties (PADGB - specifically,
recorded financial ties such as loans, credits and joint partnerships) and
marriage alliances (PADGM).
<p>
As Breiger &amp; Pattison point out, the original data are symmetrically
coded. This is acceptable perhaps for marital ties, but is unfortunate for the
financial ties (which are almost certainly directed). To remedy this, the
financial ties can be recoded as directed relations using some external
measure of power - for instance, a measure of wealth. <CODE>PADGW</CODE> provides
information on (1) each family's net wealth in 1427 (in thousands of lira);
(2) the number of priorates (seats on the civic council) held between 1282-
1344; and (3) the total number of business or marriage ties in the total
dataset of 116 families (see Breiger &amp; Pattison (1986), p 239).
<p>
Substantively, the data include families who were locked in a struggle for
political control of the city of Florence in around 1430. Two factions were
dominant in this struggle: one revolved around the infamous Medicis (9),
the other around the powerful Strozzis (15).

 </blockquote>

<p><b>BACKGROUND</b>
Hage &amp; Harary (1983) use the Gahuku-Gama system of the Eastern
Central Highlands of New Guinea, described by Read (1954), to illustrate
a clusterable signed graph. Read's ethnography portrayed an alliance
structure among three tribal groups containing balance as a special case;
among Gahuku-Gama the enemy of an enemy can be either a friend or an
enemy.
<p>
The signed graph has been split into two matrices:  <CODE>GAMAPOS</CODE> for
alliance ("rova") relations, <CODE>GAMANEG</CODE> for antagonistic ("hina")
relations. To reconstruct the signed graph, multiply GAMANEG by -1, and
add the two matrices.

<p><b>BACKGROUND</b>
Sampson recorded the social interactions among a group of monks while
resident as an experimenter on vision, and collected numerous sociometric
rankings. During his stay, a political "crisis in the cloister" resulted in the
expulsion of four monks (Nos. 2, 3, 17, and 18) and the voluntary
departure of several others - most immediately, Nos. 1, 7, 14, 15, and 16.
(In the end, only 5, 6, 9, and 11 remained).
<p>
Most of the present data are retrospective, collected after the breakup
occurred. They concern a period during which a new cohort entered the
monastery near the end of the study but before the major conflict began.
The exceptions are "liking" data gathered at three times: <CODE>SAMPLK1</CODE> to
<CODE>SAMPLK3</CODE> - that reflect changes in group sentiment over time
(<CODE>SAMPLK3</CODE> was collected in the same wave as the data described below).
Information about the senior monks was not included.
<p>
Four relations are coded, with separate matrices for positive and negative
ties on the relation. Each member ranked only his top three choices on that
tie. The relations are esteem (<CODE>SAMPES</CODE>) and disesteem (<CODE>SAMPDES</CODE>),
liking (<CODE>SAMPLK</CODE>) and disliking (<CODE>SAMPDLK</CODE>), positive influence
(<CODE>SAMPIN</CODE>) and negative influence (<CODE>SAMPNIN</CODE>), praise (<CODE>SAMPPR</CODE>) and
blame (<CODE>SAMPNPR</CODE>). In all rankings 3 indicates the highest or first choice
and 1 the last choice. (Some subjects offered tied ranks for their top four
choices).

<p><b>DATASET</b> 	<A HREF="./taro.dat"><CODE>TARO</CODE></A>
<p><b>DESCRIPTION</b> 	One 22&#215;22 matrix, symmetric, binary.
<p><b>BACKGROUND</b>
These data represent the relation of gift-giving (taro exchange) among 22
households in a Papuan village. Hage &amp; Harary (1983) used them to
illustrate a graph hamiltonian cycle. Schwimmer points out how these ties
function to define the appropriate persons to mediate the act of asking for
or receiving assistance among group members.

<p><b>BACKGROUND</b>
These data come from a six-year research project, concluded in 1976, on
corporate power in nine European countries and the United States. Each
matrix represents corporate interlocks among the major business entities
of two countries - the Netherlands (<CODE>SZCID</CODE>) and West Germany
(<CODE>SZCIG</CODE>).

<p><b>BACKGROUND</b>
Thurman spent 16 months observing the interactions among employees in
the overseas office of a large international corporation. During this time,
two major disputes erupted in a subgroup of fifteen people. Thurman
analyzed the outcome of these disputes in terms of the network of formal
and informal associations among those involved.
<p>
<CODE>THURA</CODE> shows the formal organizational chart of the employees and
<CODE>THURM</CODE> the actors linked by multiplex ties.

 <CODE>WOLFI</CODE>: One 20&#215;4 matrix, valued.

<p><b>BACKGROUND</b>
These data represent 3 months of interactions among a troop of monkeys,
observed in the wild by Linda Wolfe as they sported by a river in Ocala,
Florida. Joint presence at the river was coded as an interaction and these
were summed within all pairs (<CODE>WOLFN</CODE>).
<p>
<CODE>WOLFK</CODE> indicates the putative kin relationships among the animals: 18
may be the granddaughter of 19. <CODE>WOLFI</CODE> contains four columns of
information about the individual animals:  (1) ID number of the animal;
(2) age in years; (3) sex; (4) rank in the troop.

<p><b>DATASET</b> 	<A HREF="./zachary.dat"><CODE>ZACHARY</CODE></A>
<p><b>DESCRIPTION</b> 	Two 34&#215;34 matrices.
 <blockquote>
  <CODE>ZACHE</CODE> symmetric, binary.<br>
  <CODE>ZACHC</CODE> symmetric, valued.
 </blockquote>

<p><b>BACKGROUND</b>
These are data collected from the members of a university
karate club by Wayne Zachary. The <CODE>ZACHE</CODE> matrix represents
the presence or absence of ties among the members of the club;
the <CODE>ZACHC</CODE> matrix indicates the relative strength of the
associations (number of situations in and outside the club in
which interactions occurred).
<p>
Zachary (1977) used these data and an information flow model
of network conflict resolution to explain the split-up of this
group following disputes among the members.
