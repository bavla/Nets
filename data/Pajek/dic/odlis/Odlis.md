<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The network <tt>Odlis.net</tt> is based on the
<tt>ODLIS</tt>:
<a href="./Odlis.pdf"><i>Online Dictionary of Library and Information Science</i></a>.
 version December 2000.
</p>
<p>
ODLIS is designed to be a hypertext reference resource for library and information
science professionals, university students and faculty, and users of all types of
libraries. The primary criterion for including a new term is whether a librarian
or other information professional might reasonably be expected to encounter
it at some point in his (or her) career, or be required to know its meaning
in the course of executing his or her responsibilities as a librarian.
The vocabulary of publishing, printing, book history, literature, and computer
science has been included when, in the author's judgment, a definition might
prove helpful, not only to library and information professionals, but also
to laypersons.
</p>
<p>

</p><p>
An arc (X,Y) from term X to term Y exists in the network iff
in the ODLIS dictionary the term Y is used to describe the meaning of term X.
</p><p>
ODLIS  is the work of Joan M. Reitz, Assistant Professor/Instruction Librarian
at the Ruth A. Haas Library, Western Connecticut State University (WCSU) in Danbury,
CT. Ms. Reitz holds an M.L.I.S. degree (1991) from the University of Washington
in Seattle and an M.A. degree (1998) in European History from Western Connecticut
State University. Her primary research interests are the history of the book
and history of political and social revolutions.

<h3>History</h3>
<p>
<ol>
<li> ODLIS began at the Haas Library in 1994 as a five-page photocopied handout
intended for undergraduates not fluent in English, and students with
limited exposure to library terminology.
</li>
<li> In 1996, it was expanded and converted to HTML format for installation on the
WCSU Libraries HomePage under the title Hypertext Library Lingo:
A Glossary of Library Terminology.
</li>
<li> In 1997, many more hypertext links were added and the format improved in response
to suggestions from users.
</li>
<li>
 During the summer of 1999, several hundred terms and definitions were added,
 and a generic version created which omitted all references to the specific
 conditions and practices at the Haas Library.
</li>
<li>
 In the fall of 1999, the glossary was expanded to 1,800 terms, renamed to reflect
 its extended scope, and copyrighted.
</li>
<li>
 In February, 2000, ODLIS was indexed in Yahoo! under "Reference - Dictionaries - Subject."
 It is also indexed in the WorldCat database in OCLC FirstSearch.
</li>
<li>
 During the year 2000, the dictionary was expanded to 2,600 terms.
 On average, it has received over 6,200 visits per month since January 2, 2000.
</li>
<li> December 2000: <tt>ODLIS</tt> transformed in Pajek format and 'cleaned' by
     A. Mrvar and V. Batagelj.</li>
