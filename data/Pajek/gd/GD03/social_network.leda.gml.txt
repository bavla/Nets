** Description

This document contains one of two graphs provided for 
the 2003 Graph Drawing Contest.  

It is a small social network, in which nodes represent organizations 
involved in drug policy making, and edges represent (undirected) informal 
communication between members of different organizations.  Due to the 
nature of the data, there is uncertainty about the existence of a relation.
Confirmed relations, i.e. those that exist for sure, are regarded more 
important than others.

The state of an edge is marked by a boolean attribute.

A visualization of this network should clearly depict the structure
of the overall network, of the subnetwork consisting only of confirmed
relations, and the way in which the latter is embedded in the former.
