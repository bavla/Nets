    <h1>GD2002: Graph Drawing Contest</h1>
    <h2>Organized by Franz J. Brandenburg</h2>
    <hr></hr>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>The graph drawing competition and the nomination of the winners has been among
      the highlights of the past graph drawing symposia. It's both fun and a challenge
      and has inspired new research in graph drawing.</p>

    <p>The ninth annual graph-drawing contest will be held in conjunction with Graph Drawing 2002.</p>

    </table>

    <p>Winning entries for each graph will be chosen by a jury of experts. Drawings of GraphA and GraphB may be submitted electronically or by mail.
      All submissions must be received before midnight, August 21, 2002. (Note: This is a hard deadline.)
      A prize fund of $750 is anticipated. As usual, the winning entries will be described in the GD symposium proceedings.</p>

    <h2>How to Enter the Competition</h2>

    Graphs A, B, and C and incidental background information are available via the above links.

    <p>Unless contradicted by the specific instructions for each graph, you are free to use any visual or textual mechanism to communicate the graph data.</p>

    <p>The primary judging criterion will be how well the drawings or interaction convey this data. A secondary criterion will be the degree to which manual editing was required to produce them: the less manual intervention, the better.</p>

    <p>You can submit entries of any or all of these graphs before midnight, August 21, 2002.
      Drawings can be submitted electronically in Postscript or PDF format to Franz Brandenburg (
      <a href="mailto:brandenb@fmi.uni-passau.de">brandenb@fmi.uni-passau.de</a>).</p>

    <p>Questions or comments should be directed to Franz Brandenburg (<a href="mailto:brandenb@fmi.uni-passau.de">brandenb@fmi.uni-passau.de</a>).</p>
