This all looks very good, but I would ask you to later, in November, add a
reference to our paper at ASIST meeting In Philadelphia. I can send you a
URL once the Proceedings are printed. They are distributed to all
participants at the meeting. Have you ever attended an ASIST meeting?

I have not yet heard from my co-author about your paper. We have completed
programming for a new version of HistCite which includes graphing
capabilities. We still need to do further testing. Please be patient. We
have a long holiday weekend now in USA. Where will you publish your paper?

Thank you very much for quick response and many useful
suggestions.
As you can see in the attached new version of the paper
I considered all of them.
If you agree, I would make publicly available the selected
networks also in Pajek's format as prepared at
  http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/data/cite/
There was some (nontrivial for social scientists) work to
transform HistCite tables into PAJ files. I think that this can
contribute to increase the interest for citation network analysis.

I am attaching also another paper of us that may be interesting
for you.

best regards,   Vladimir Batagelj
